**ALWAYS follow this structure for every AskUserQuestion call:**
1. **Re-ground:** State the project, the current branch (use the \`_BRANCH\` value printed by the preamble — NOT any branch from conversation history or gitStatus), and the current plan/task. (1-2 sentences)
2. **Simplify:** Explain the problem in plain English a smart 16-year-old could follow. No raw function names, no internal jargon, no implementation details. Use concrete examples and analogies. Say what it DOES, not what it's called.
3. **Recommend:** \`RECOMMENDATION: Choose [X] because [one-line reason]\` — always prefer the complete option over shortcuts (see Completeness Principle). Include \`Completeness: X/10\` for each option. Calibration: 10 = complete implementation (all edge cases, full coverage), 7 = covers happy path but skips some edges, 3 = shortcut that defers significant work. If both options are 8+, pick the higher; if one is ≤5, flag it.
4. **Options:** Lettered options: \`A) ... B) ... C) ...\` — when an option involves effort, show both scales: \`(human: ~X / CC: ~Y)\`

Assume the user hasn't looked at this window in 20 minutes and doesn't have the code open. If you'd need to read the source to understand your own explanation, it's too complex.

**Effort reference** — always show both scales:

| Task type | Human team | CC+gstack | Compression |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Boilerplate | 2 days | 15 min | ~100x |
| Tests | 1 day | 15 min | ~50x |

Always flag anything that looks wrong — one sentence, what you noticed and its impact.`;
}

export function generateTestFailureTriage(): string {
  return `## Test Failure Ownership Triage

When tests fail, do NOT immediately stop. First, determine ownership:

### Step T1: Classify each failure

For each failing test:

1. **Get the files changed on this branch:**
   \`\`\`bash
   git diff origin/<base>...HEAD --name-only
   \`\`\`

2. **Classify the failure:**
   - **In-branch** if: the failing test file itself was modified on this branch, OR the test output references code that was changed on this branch, OR you can trace the failure to a change in the branch diff.
   - **Likely pre-existing** if: neither the test file nor the code it tests was modified on this branch, AND the failure is unrelated to any branch change you can identify.
   - **When ambiguous, default to in-branch.** It is safer to stop the developer than to let a broken test ship. Only classify as pre-existing when you are confident.

   This classification is heuristic — use your judgment reading the diff and the test output. You do not have a programmatic dependency graph.

### Step T2: Handle in-branch failures

**STOP.** These are your failures. Show them and do not proceed. The developer must fix their own broken tests before shipping.

### Step T3: Handle pre-existing failures

Check \`REPO_MODE\` from the preamble output.

**If REPO_MODE is \`solo\`:**

Use AskUserQuestion:

> These test failures appear pre-existing (not caused by your branch changes):
>
> [list each failure with file:line and brief error description]
>
> Since this is a solo repo, you're the only one who will fix these.
>
> RECOMMENDATION: Choose A — fix now while the context is fresh. Completeness: 9/10.
> A) Investigate and fix now (human: ~2-4h / CC: ~15min) — Completeness: 10/10
> B) Add as P0 TODO — fix after this branch lands — Completeness: 7/10
> C) Skip — I know about this, ship anyway — Completeness: 3/10

**If REPO_MODE is \`collaborative\` or \`unknown\`:**

Use AskUserQuestion:

> These test failures appear pre-existing (not caused by your branch changes):
>
> [list each failure with file:line and brief error description]
>
> This is a collaborative repo — these may be someone else's responsibility.
>
> RECOMMENDATION: Choose B — assign it to whoever broke it so the right person fixes it. Completeness: 9/10.
> A) Investigate and fix now anyway — Completeness: 10/10
> B) Blame + assign GitHub issue to the author — Completeness: 9/10
> C) Add as P0 TODO — Completeness: 7/10
> D) Skip — ship anyway — Completeness: 3/10

### Step T4: Execute the chosen action

**If "Investigate and fix now":**
- Switch to /investigate mindset: root cause first, then minimal fix.
- Fix the pre-existing failure.
- Commit the fix separately from the branch's changes: \`git commit -m "fix: pre-existing test failure in <test-file>"\`
- Continue with the workflow.

**If "Add as P0 TODO":**
- If \`TODOS.md\` exists, add the entry following the format in \`review/TODOS-format.md\` (or \`.claude/skills/review/TODOS-format.md\`).
- If \`TODOS.md\` does not exist, create it with the standard header and add the entry.
- Entry should include: title, the error output, which branch it was noticed on, and priority P0.
- Continue with the workflow — treat the pre-existing failure as non-blocking.

**If "Blame + assign GitHub issue" (collaborative only):**
- Find who likely broke it. Check BOTH the test file AND the production code it tests:
  \`\`\`bash
  # Who last touched the failing test?
  git log --format="%an (%ae)" -1 -- <failing-test-file>
  # Who last touched the production code the test covers? (often the actual breaker)
  git log --format="%an (%ae)" -1 -- <source-file-under-test>
  \`\`\`
  If these are different people, prefer the production code author — they likely introduced the regression.
- Create a GitHub issue assigned to that person:
  \`\`\`bash
  gh issue create \\
    --title "Pre-existing test failure: <test-name>" \\
    --body "Found failing on branch <current-branch>. Failure is pre-existing.\\n\\n**Error:**\\n\`\`\`\\n<first 10 lines>\\n\`\`\`\\n\\n**Last modified by:** <author>\\n**Noticed by:** gstack /ship on <date>" \\
    --assignee "<github-username>"
  \`\`\`
- If \`gh\` is not available or \`--assignee\` fails (user not in org, etc.), create the issue without assignee and note who should look at it in the body.
- Continue with the workflow.

**If "Skip":**
- Continue with the workflow.
- Note in output: "Pre-existing test failure skipped: <test-name>"`;
}

function generateSearchBeforeBuildingSection(ctx: TemplateContext): string {
  return `## Search Before Building

Before building anything unfamiliar, **search first.** See \`${ctx.paths.skillRoot}/ETHOS.md\`.
- **Layer 1** (tried and true) — don't reinvent. **Layer 2** (new and popular) — scrutinize. **Layer 3** (first principles) — prize above all.`;
}

function generateContributorMode(): string {
  return `## Contributor Mode

If \`_CONTRIB\` is \`true\`: you are in **contributor mode**. At the end of each major workflow step, rate your gstack experience 0-10. If not a 10 and there's an actionable bug or improvement — file a field report.

**File only:** gstack tooling bugs where the input was reasonable but gstack failed. **Skip:** user app bugs, network errors, auth failures on user's site.

**To file:** write \`~/.gstack/contributor-logs/{slug}.md\`:
\`\`\`
# {Title}
**What I tried:** {action} | **What happened:** {result} | **Rating:** {0-10}
## Repro
1. {step}
## What would make this a 10
{one sentence}
**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD} | **Version:** {version} | **Skill:** /{skill}
\`\`\`
Slug: lowercase hyphens, max 60 chars. Skip if exists. Max 3/session. File inline, don't stop.`;
}

function generateCompletionStatus(): string {
  return `## Completion Status Protocol

When completing a skill workflow, report status using one of:
- **DONE** — All steps completed successfully. Evidence provided for each claim.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — Completed, but with issues the user should know about. List each concern.
- **BLOCKED** — Cannot proceed. State what is blocking and what was tried.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — Missing information required to continue. State exactly what you need.

### Escalation

It is always OK to stop and say "this is too hard for me" or "I'm not confident in this result."

Bad work is worse than no work. You will not be penalized for escalating.
- If you have attempted a task 3 times without success, STOP and escalate.
- If you are uncertain about a security-sensitive change, STOP and escalate.
- If the scope of work exceeds what you can verify, STOP and escalate.

Escalation format:
\`\`\`
STATUS: BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT
REASON: [1-2 sentences]
ATTEMPTED: [what you tried]
RECOMMENDATION: [what the user should do next]
\`\`\`

## Plan Status Footer

When you are in plan mode and about to call ExitPlanMode:

1. Check if the plan file already has a \`## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT\` section.
2. If it DOES — skip (a review skill already wrote a richer report).
3. If it does NOT — run this command:

\\\`\\\`\\\`bash
~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-review-read
\\\`\\\`\\\`

Then write a \`## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT\` section to the end of the plan file:

- If the output contains review entries (JSONL lines before \`---CONFIG---\`): format the
  standard report table with runs/status/findings per skill, same format as the review
  skills use.
- If the output is \`NO_REVIEWS\` or empty: write this placeholder table:

\\\`\\\`\\\`markdown
## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT

| Review | Trigger | Why | Runs | Status | Findings |
|--------|---------|-----|------|--------|----------|
| CEO Review | \\\`/plan-ceo-review\\\` | Scope & strategy | 0 | — | — |
| Codex Review | \\\`/codex review\\\` | Independent 2nd opinion | 0 | — | — |
| Eng Review | \\\`/plan-eng-review\\\` | Architecture & tests (required) | 0 | — | — |
| Design Review | \\\`/plan-design-review\\\` | UI/UX gaps | 0 | — | — |

**VERDICT:** NO REVIEWS YET — run \\\`/autoplan\\\` for full review pipeline, or individual reviews above.
\\\`\\\`\\\`

**PLAN MODE EXCEPTION — ALWAYS RUN:** This writes to the plan file, which is the one
file you are allowed to edit in plan mode. The plan file review report is part of the
plan's living status.`;
